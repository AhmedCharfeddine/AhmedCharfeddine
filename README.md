Hi, Iâ€™m @AhmedCharfeddine, a software engineer interested in exploring and diving deep into how things work under the hood.

I'm particularly into system design, backend engineering, tech concepts, and DSA (have a look at my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/AhmedCharfeddine/)).

ðŸ“« You can reach me on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-charfeddine/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01dd1972b174c2095a), or at <ahmed.charfeddine@outlook.com>

Thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
